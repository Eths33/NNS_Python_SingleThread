# NNS_Cpp_SingleThread
Nearest Neighbor Search

Author: Greg Gutmann

Designed as an introduction to one implementation of a nearest neighbor search. It has been created as a mirror of the C/C++ demo that I previously made as a teaching tool for my work at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

Simplicity was preferred over performance in this code.
